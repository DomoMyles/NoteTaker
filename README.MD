Note Taker.
Motovation.
my motovation in creating this project is to create a type of note taking website that logs what notes you have taken for you to view at later dates.

This is a great way to keep notes o your computer.

I learned a lot about how databases can react with a javascript file and how to edit and locate files from other directories.

One thing i had a lot of trouble with was the delete function. I simply could not get the system to find the id of the note that I wanted to delete
